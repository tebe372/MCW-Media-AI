# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Attendee guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What is your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

#  Media AI whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to look at the various options and services available to you in Azure to design a video-based learning solution that supports uploading and playback of videos, as well as using the more advanced AI capabilities of the platform.

By the end of the whiteboard design session you will be better able to design media applications including setup of the Video Indexer API, upload videos to Blob Storage to be encoded with Azure Video Indexer, and integrate Video Indexer through Logic Apps and Azure Functions.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer’s needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator or SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.
1.  Meet your table participants and trainer. 
2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide.
3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Consulting is a mature consulting firm that has been in the IT Consulting business for over 30 years with clients all over the world. They have a history of mainly specializing in Microsoft technologies, but do have an established practice of offering Linux and OSS based consulting. The company has adapted to the ever-changing landscape of IT for a long time and has been involved in the training and adoption or transition process of many of its clients over the years. In addition to IT consulting services, Contoso provides on-site and video-based training to their larger clients. This involves creating custom training content and course agendas based on the client's needs and project being delivered.

Clients have always gotten a lot of value out of Contoso Consulting's training classes. Even though Contoso has trained the clients development and/or engineering teams, they are still brought back for future work since they have been able to deliver such great value over the years. Over the last couple years, clients have been asking them for more and more training courses. The referrals for training have been trickling down and coming from many of Contoso's smaller clients in addition to their larger clients. They have had to turn away a lot of smaller training contract opportunities due to the inability to create solutions affordable enough for their smaller clients.

Due to the efforts of their sales teams, Contoso has created many video-based training classes they have been able to deliver to clients using DVDs or MP4 files. While this enables them to reuse training content and deliver it in a more affordable and scalable manner, it just does not give them the full capabilities they would like. As the content ages, the DVDs or MP4s are no longer relevant and clients are solely purchasing individual courses. They have also used some of the available video hosting services on the market with only limited success. Everything they have tried so far has not quite offered the features and capabilities that an Enterprise needs for a good quality video streaming experience.

Because of this changing landscape of getting further into the IT training business, the CEO of Contoso Consulting, Jill Sampson, has decided to pursue the development of Contoso's own online, on-demand, video training service. Jill says, "I want to build the Netflix of IT training!" This new service will allow Contoso to easily resell subscriptions to their clients for all of their video training courses. This will include general courses that any client can be sold, to one-off custom courses built for specific clients based on their own specific IT infrastructure or custom software that Contoso has delivered to them.

Mary Bowman, the Director of IT Operations for Contoso, has seen some demos of the media and video services within the Microsoft Azure platform. However, she still has several questions to answer before making a final decision on the technology and platforms to use for implementation. The Contoso IT Development and Engineering teams do not have much experience with building and maintaining video streaming services, so they are a bit uncertain of what path to take with the design and architecture at this point. In initial conversations with the sales team, Mary has said, "We have a tremendous amount of Enterprise IT experience within our organization, we just need a little help figuring out the unknowns here."

### Customer needs

1.  The system must scale globally for their many clients all over the world, including new clients as Contoso grows their IT training business.

2.  They need to lessen the burden of content development by automatically generating video transcripts (video captions) and translate those into many other languages as well.

3.  Copy protection or DRM are desired to keep their IP from getting stolen.

4.  The ability to easily search through the content is needed so the service can be an easy to use lookup reference.

5.  The system needs to have an administration portal where new and updated content can be maintained by their internal staff.

6.  Use serverless compute where possible to minimize overall maintenance and overhead cost.

### Customer objections 

1.  Is there a service to automate transcription of the videos? Manual transcription is costly.

2.  There are plenty of video encoding tools out there, but what does Azure offer to do this more easily?

3.  Do we need to hire translators to translate the transcripts into other languages?

4.  When we grow our library of content, how are we going to ensure the search capabilities stay responsive?

# Media AI whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

-   Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer.

-   Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"

-   Briefly review the steps and timeframes of the whiteboard design session.

-   Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin.

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

-   Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time.

-   Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

-   Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

## Step 3: Present the solution

-   Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins.

-   For the first round, assign one table as the Microsoft team and the other table as the customer.

-   Have the presenting team present their solution to the customer team.

    -   Have the customer team provide one objection for the presenting team to respond to.
    
    -   The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes.
    
    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

-   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

##  Preferred target audience

Jill Sampson, Chief Executive Officer

Mary Bowman, Director of IT Operations

## Preferred solution

The preferred solution consists of the following high-level components:

1.  Admin website through which videos can be uploaded by Contoso employees.

2.  "Public" or end-user website through which customers of Contoso can watch video courses, including access to Video Insights such as transcriptions, captions, and search features.

3.  Background processing that is implemented with a serverless architecture using Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions. This background processing orchestrates the video upload or encoding workflow.

4.  Azure Video Indexer service or API provides video encoding and indexing capabilities, as well as video streaming to the "public" or end-user website.

5.  Backend database is used to store application data. It is recommended to use Azure Cosmos DB for higher scalability, but Azure SQL Database could also be implemented.

The following High-Level Diagram displays the overall, general architecture of the preferred solution:

![Icons that are connected by arrows comprise this rectangular diagram. From the top left, Web App -- Admin Site points linearly down to Azure Storage, which points right to a blue box labeled Azure Logic App. In this box, Azure Logic App points at Video Indexer Connector and the blue box points right to Video Indexer Service. The rest of the icons use double-sided arrows and point to and from: Video Indexer Service up to Web App -- Frontend, left to Database, which points down through the middle of the rectangle to Azure Function and back down to the blue Azure Logic App box. A double-sided arrow also connects Azure Function to Video Indexer Service and on the right side, a double-sided arrow points from Web App -- Frontend to Media Player.](images/Whiteboarddesignsessiontrainerguide-MediaAIimages/media/image4.png "Solution architecture diagram")


**Admin and "public" or end-user website**

-   Hosted using Azure Web Apps

-   Separate App Service Plan for each app so they can be scaled independently.

-   Admin website secures using Azure AD so only Contoso employees can access it.

**Video Encoding and Transcription**

-   Use Azure Video Indexer API

-   Provides Video Encoding

-   Provides Video Transcription (Audio and OCR) -- including automatic translation into many different languages (*English, Chinese, German, etc.*).

**Background Processing**

-   Video files uploaded to Azure Storage Account

-   Azure Logic App triggered to upload videos to Video Indexer service.

-   Azure Function integrated with Logic App to update Video processing status in back-end database.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  Is there a service to automate transcription of the videos? Manual transcription is costly.
    
    **Potential Answer**

    Microsoft has gone through a couple generations of transcription services and APIs over the years. The most recent and most accurate transcription functionality is contained within the Video Indexer service that is part of Cognitive Services. Video Indexer can easily generate transcripts for both audio and video.

2.  There are plenty of video encoding tools out there, but what does Azure offer to do this more easily?
    
    **Potential Answer**

    The Video Indexer that is part of Cognitive Services provides a PaaS service that enables customers with digital and audio content to automatically extract metadata and use it to build intelligent innovative applications.

    Azure Media Services does offer video encoding and delivery as a PaaS service, but it is pretty "bare-bones" in its functionality.

3.  Do we need to hire translators to translate the transcripts into other languages?
    
    **Potential Answer**

    The traditional path would be to hire translators to accurately translate content to different languages. The Video Indexer service, in addition to its transcription and other cognitive capabilities, can translate the transcriptions into many different supported languages without any effort on your part.

4.  When we grow our library of content, how are we going to ensure the search capabilities stay responsive?

    **Potential Answer**

    The Video Indexer service does provide text search APIs that can be used to implement search capabilities. If a different search service is necessary, it is possible to feed video transcripts into another search service or database.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"Your expertise, along with the proposed solution architecture, really fills in the gaps to help us build the on-demand video training service that will help our company grow to new heights!"

\- Mary Bowman, Director of IT Operations
