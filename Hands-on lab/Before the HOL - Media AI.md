    -   Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or later


## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

In this lab, you will create a developer environment and download the required files for this course if you do not already have one that meets the requirements.

### Task 1: Configure a development environment

If you do not have a machine setup with Visual Studio 2017 Community complete this task.

1.  Create a virtual machine in Azure using the **Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64)** image. This is important as you need to have Visual Studio 2017 version 15.4 or later to complete this lab.

    ![In this screenshot, visual studio community 2017 is entered in a search box, and the Visual Studio Community 2017 (latest release) on Windows Server 2016 (x64) row is selected and highlighted in the search results.](images/Setup/image3.png "Use the image above to create a virtual machine in Azure")

    > It is **highly** recommended to use a DS2_v2 or D2s_v3 instance size for this VM.

    > You will also need to make sure to enable RDP (port 3389) inbound access to the VM.

### Task 2: Disable IE enhanced security

> Note: Sometimes this image has IE ESC disabled, and sometimes it does not.

1.  On the new VM, you just created click the Server Manager icon.
